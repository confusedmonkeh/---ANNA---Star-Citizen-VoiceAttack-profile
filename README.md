---ANNA---Star-Citizen-VoiceAttack-profile V 0.1
==========================================

Fully state aware VoiceAttack profile - Anna -

Anna is a VoiceAttack profile for Star Citizen that can hnadle all kinds of ship operating procedures and mechanics. 

She will manage your power requirements by effortlessly moving between 7 different pre-set states all whilst keeping track of her curent state. 

She will set your IFCS to whatever is specified, both on, both off, just G-Safe off or on, just Commstab off or on all with state tracking to ensure neither of you get muddled up.

She can change your camera, drop flares, fire missiles, shift the balance of your shields and so much more, all whilst keeping track of the current state and making sure you fly to the best of your abilities.

To make her fully aware Anna uses 'states' that she can remember.
 
To make this profile work you will need to reset your states every time you die. Saying respawn, reset or reboot will re-set your states to their default position, (and respawn you), if you do this when flying and states have been moved from default beforehand, it will not work.

and plenty more...

Some of those follow on from each other and will make a fun little conversation. Lot's of random replies should keep it interesting. More can always be added if you hear the same thing too often, just let me know.

This will remain a work in progress so feel free to suggest additions or improvements and I hope a few find it useful, fun or maybe even a little bit of both. It's set up to call me 'Monk' or 'Monkeh' so obviously if this isn't your name you can go and edit those bits out at your leisure. 

To use Anna, just extract the file into your VoiceAttack profiles folder and then import it into VoiceAttack. Please ensure you have the <a href="http://www.voiceattack.com/beta.aspx"><b>LATEST VOICEATTACK BETA VERSION</b></a> or it will not work. The voice I'm using is <a href="http://www.ivona.com/en/products/voice-amy/">Amy from IVONA.com</a>.

Enjoy. Let me know what you think and how to make it better, thanks.
